### We will typically have two different spaces: one local and one shared, even within this
### deployment space. 
###
### There ought to be a shared root space, that we can use as a basis for code and data 
### that can be shared effectively. AWS configuration places the bulk of the local storage
### under /mnt, and we ought to respect that. 

vendor_base: "/mnt/ibc"

vendor_build: "/mnt/build"

vendor_data: "/mnt/data"

vendor_source: "/mnt/source"

vendor_scratch: "/mnt/scratch"

vendor_log: "/mnt/log"

### Some other data that is probably best exposed as public.
