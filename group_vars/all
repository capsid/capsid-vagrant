### We will typically have two different spaces: one local and one shared, even within this
### deployment space. 
###
### There ought to be a shared root space, that we can use as a basis for code and data 
### that can be shared effectively. AWS configuration places the bulk of the local storage
### under /mnt, and we ought to respect that. 

shared_storage_role: none
